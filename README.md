# Building_Energy_Prediction
How much energy will a building consume?

## Business Objective:
Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption(with retrofits) and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. With better estimates of how much the energy a building is actually going to consume, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. Hence, significant investments can be made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions.

Retrofits:- Energy saving instruments
